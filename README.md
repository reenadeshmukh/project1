The aim of the project is to avoid collision of vehicles coming in the same lane of road by monitoring the vehicles using STM32cubeIDE,uart,GSM MODULE,GPS module and sensors.
Detection of accidents is done automatically by using a setup that will be embedded in the vehicles.
Once the collision is detected it will sense it and will inform the emergency  contacts.
